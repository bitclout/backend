To add a migration, simply do the following:
* Choose a new filename (timestamp and suffix)
* Copy an existing migration over to a new file with that name
* Modify the Exec commands to suit your needs
* The other modules will pick up the migration as long as it follows the same
  filename format. It does this by importing the "Migrations" var defined in main.go
